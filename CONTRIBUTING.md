## Setting up and getting started

The Rails Girls Summer of Code website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In order to set up and run the site locally for development, you'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine. After making sure that Ruby is installed, bundle the gems using bundler and start jekyll:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
jekyll serve --watch

```

To see the site locally, just head to `http://localhost:4000` in your browser. You're ready to go!
